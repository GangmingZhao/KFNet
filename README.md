# KFNet
Learning Temporal Camera Relocalization using Kalman Filtering


## About

## How to use

### File format

The input folder of a project should have two file lists: `image_list.txt` comprising an full image path in each line in sequence, and `label_list.txt` comprising a full label path in each line corresponding to the images. The label files are generated by the `tofile()` function of numpy matrices which store the scene coordinates of pixels. The label maps have a resolution 8 times lower than the images. For example, for the [7scenes]() dataset, the images have a resolution of 480x640, while the label maps have a resolution of 60x80.

### Environment

The codes are tested along with python 2.7 and tensorflow 1.12.

### Command

For testing, run:

```python
git checkout KFNet
python KFNet/eval.py --input_folder <input_folder> --output_folder <output_folder> --model_folder <model_folder> --scene <scene>
```
